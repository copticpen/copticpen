    <h1>Coptic Pen</h1>
    <p>These are <span>
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;

        <span>thoughts, feelings, poems, lyrics, translations,
          biographies and nonsense written in Coptic language.
          Why do I write in a dead language? What purpose does it serve?

          I just write in Coptic language</span></span></p>
